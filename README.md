We analyze data containing the percentage of the population with access to
electricity (PPAE) in different African countries, taking into account historical
patterns. In order to give a full assessment of electricity access dynamics,
the research uses a different approach that includes quantitative analysis,
regression modeling, and interactive geoJSON maps.
We explore an electricity data from a reliable international sources. The
exploration revealed a variation in the PPAE across different countries. These
variations are represented through interactive geojson maps, showing the
variation of PPAE over the past years.This map gives users the ability to
interactively explore data, enabling a greater comprehension of electricity
access. The study underlines a slow but encouraging progress towards
improving access to electricity by the population.
Additionally, regression models are used in the study to find the relationships
between time and PPAE. The regression models are linear, polynomial,
random forest regressions, and decision tree model.This offer insights into
the changing condition of energy access by highlighting the part that various
factors play in determining the availability of energy in the area. A PESTLE
analysis is done to assess external environmental factors affecting activities
for increasing access to energy.
The combination of the interactive maps,
regression findings, and PESTLE analysis not only gives a better understanding
of electricity access dynamics, but also offers a thorough basis for joint efforts
to improve universal energy access across African countries and sustainable
development goals.
